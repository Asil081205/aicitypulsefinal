# 🌆 AI City Pulse – Digital Health Monitor for Cities

AI City Pulse is an innovative smart city mobile application that treats a city like a living organism and measures its "health" similar to a human pulse.

This project supports **United Nations SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities** by using Artificial Intelligence to monitor, analyze, and visualize city health indicators in real time.

## 🚀 Project Vision

Cities generate massive amounts of data every second:
- 🚦 Traffic congestion
- 🌫️ Air pollution
- 🔊 Noise levels
- 👥 Crowd density
- ⚡ Power usage

AI City Pulse converts this data into a single **City Stress Score** to determine whether a city is healthy, overloaded, or at risk.

## 🧠 Core Concept

Just like a doctor checks:
- Heart Rate
- Blood Pressure
- Oxygen Level

AI City Pulse checks:
- Traffic Pressure
- Pollution Index
- Noise Index
- Crowd Density
- Energy Consumption

Then calculates a:

# 💓 City Health Score
